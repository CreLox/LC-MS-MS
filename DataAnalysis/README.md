# Procedures
1. Extract data from .raw files into .mzXML

In order to extract data in the ThermoFisher's proprietary binary .raw format, we use `MSConvertGUI` here to extract the data into an open format like .mzXML. Make sure that the `SRM as spectra` box is checked.

2. Use the `plotD7.m` code to plot the data.
